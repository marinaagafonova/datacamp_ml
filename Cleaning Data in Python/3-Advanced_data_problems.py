# ---------- Exercise "Uniform currencies" ----------

# Find values of acct_cur that are equal to 'euro'
acct_eu = banking['acct_cur'] == 'euro'

# Convert acct_amount where it is in euro to dollars

# Assert that only dollar currency remains

# ---------- Exercise "Uniform dates" ----------

# Print the header of account_opened

# Store fund columns to sum against

# ---------- Exercise "Missing investors" ----------

# Print number of missing values in banking

# ---------- Exercise "Follow the money" ----------

# Drop missing values of cust_id
